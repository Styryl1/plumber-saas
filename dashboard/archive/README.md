# Dashboard Archive

**Purpose**: Long-term storage for outdated but historically valuable patterns

## Archive Organization

### By Date
- `2025-01/` - January 2025 archived patterns
- `2025-02/` - February 2025 archived patterns
- etc.

### By Category
- `deprecated-apis/` - Old API patterns no longer relevant
- `legacy-ui/` - Superseded UI patterns
- `outdated-integrations/` - Old third-party integration patterns

## Archive Criteria

Patterns are archived when:
- Unused for >180 days
- Superseded by better patterns
- Technology/dependency became obsolete
- Success rate dropped below 50%

## Retrieval Process

1. Check archive metadata for pattern location
2. Review pattern for current relevance
3. Update and move back to REFERENCE if still valuable
4. Create new pattern inspired by archived version if needed
