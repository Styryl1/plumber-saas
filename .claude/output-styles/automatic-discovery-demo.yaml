    ### Implementation: Schedule-X Calendar Integration
    **Specialist**: ui-specialist-agent
    **Work Area**: dashboard
    
    New mobile-first calendar component with Dutch localization:
    ```typescript
    export const PlumberCalendar = () => {
      // Schedule-X integration with Amsterdam timezone
    }
    ```
    
    **Why this pattern works:**
    Perfect mobile experience for plumbers working on-site with touch optimization
    
    **Competitive advantage:**
    Superior mobile UX compared to ServiceM8 and Jobber
    
    **Dutch market application:**
    Amsterdam timezone, Dutch holidays, BTW period awareness
    
    **Cross-references:**
    - Updated: T3_STACK_ARCHITECTURE.md (tRPC calendar procedures)
    - Updated: MOBILE_CALENDAR_OPTIMIZATION.md (touch interaction patterns)
    - Updated: BUSINESS_PARTNER_AI.md (calendar-aware AI suggestions)
