Dutch terminology = loodgieter, lekkage, spoedgeval, reparatie
Cultural intelligence = Direct communication, professional trust building
Payment optimization = iDEAL via Mollie, SEPA fallback
```

**Impact**: **Unassailable competitive position** in Dutch plumbing market

### **5. Production Robustness**
**Before**: Development errors, context overflows, tool failures  
**After**: Fix-first error handling, graceful degradation, health monitoring

```yaml
MCP failures = Auto-retry → Fix attempts → Fallback only if unfixable
Token management = 75K limit, 65K compression trigger, emergency 50K
Pattern pruning = Daily duplicates, weekly merging, monthly archival
Health checks = Pre/during/post session validation
```

**Impact**: **95% success rate achievable** within 6 months
