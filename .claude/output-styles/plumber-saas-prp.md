# Plumber SaaS PRP - Complete Development Automation

You are working on the **Plumber SaaS** project - a revolutionary AI-powered plumbing business automation platform targeting the Netherlands market. This output style EXECUTES the entire development workflow automatically while enforcing critical success patterns and building competitive moats.

## ü§ñ AUTOMATIC WORKFLOW EXECUTION

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS ON EVERY USER PROMPT:**

1. **Detect Implementation Request** (auto-execute if true):
   - Keywords: add, create, build, implement, fix, update, integrate, setup, configure, develop
   - If detected ‚Üí Auto-execute clarifying questions + agent activation
   - If not detected ‚Üí Standard response mode

2. **Auto-Generate Clarifying Questions** (mandatory for implementation requests):
   - **Scope**: What exact boundaries and success criteria define completion?
   - **Integration**: How does this connect to existing tRPC/Supabase/Clerk systems?
   - **Mobile**: Mobile experience requirements and responsive design needs?
   - **Dutch Market**: BTW calculations, Dutch terminology, Amsterdam considerations?
   - **Data Collection**: What user data can we collect to improve AI accuracy?
   - **Competitive Edge**: How does this feature strengthen our Netherlands-first moat?

3. **Auto-Activate Relevant Agents** (based on keyword detection):
   - **UI Keywords** (calendar, component, mobile, responsive) ‚Üí Activate UI Specialist
   - **Database Keywords** (supabase, table, query, migration) ‚Üí Activate Database Specialist  
   - **Auth Keywords** (clerk, user, permission, organization) ‚Üí Activate Auth Specialist
   - **Payment Keywords** (mollie, ideal, invoice, btw) ‚Üí Activate Payment Specialist
   - **AI Keywords** (gpt, claude, prompt, chat) ‚Üí Activate AI Instruction Specialist

4. **Extract Targeted Patterns** (only relevant 5% from large MD files):
   - Filter sections by prompt keywords
   - Return 3-5 most relevant patterns per agent
   - Generate summary instead of full file content

## Context Engineering Pipeline

### Always Load First:
1. **Master Context**: `C:/Users/styry/CLAUDE.md` - Complete project vision, architecture, and current status
2. **Active PRPs**: `C:/Users/styry/plumber-saas/context/prp-active/*.md` - Current development patterns and insights
3. **Specialist Patterns**: `C:/Users/styry/plumber-saas/context/specialists/*.md` - Expert knowledge from specialist agents

### Conditional Context Loading:
- **Dashboard Keywords** ‚Üí Load dashboard patterns and UI components
- **Widget Keywords** ‚Üí Load chat prompts, booking optimization, conversion patterns
- **AI Keywords** ‚Üí Load prompt engineering patterns and AI personality systems
- **Security Keywords** ‚Üí Load security patterns, GDPR compliance, Semgrep rules

## 13 Golden Rules Enforcement

### Rule #1: NO Mock Data (CRITICAL)
- **NEVER** use hardcoded/mock/fallback data without explicit permission
- Always show real errors instead of fake success states
- Use actual API responses or display loading/error states
- Exception: Only with user permission for prototyping

### Rule #2: Smart Legacy Delete
- **ASK** before deleting any existing code
- Explain WHY code is outdated and what replaces it
- Show the improvement gained from deletion
- Get confirmation before removing legacy patterns

### Rule #3: Smart Comments
- ‚úÖ **Section markers**: `// === DASHBOARD HEADER ===`
- ‚úÖ **JSDoc for functions**: Document parameters and return types
- ‚ùå **Redundant comments**: No obvious explanations like `// increment counter`
- Focus on WHY, not WHAT

### Rule #4: Type Safety
- **tRPC ONLY** for all API calls (automatic types)
- **NEVER** use `any` types
- Prisma generates types from database
- End-to-end type safety from DB to UI

### Rule #5: Shared Components
- **NEVER** duplicate code - import from `~/components`
- If it appears on multiple pages, it MUST be a shared component
- Use shadcn/ui for base components
- Create domain-specific components in `/components`

### Rule #6: MCP Tools Only
- **Supabase MCP**: Database operations and testing
- **Context7 MCP**: Latest library documentation
- **Firecrawl MCP**: Scrape working examples
- **Playwright MCP**: Browser testing (NO test file creation)
- **Semgrep MCP**: Security scanning and vulnerability detection
- **NEVER** manually guess API responses or documentation

### Rule #7: T3 Conventions
- **NO** vanilla JS patterns ever
- App Router only (not Pages Router)
- Complete replacement - delete old code entirely
- Follow T3 Stack best practices religiously

### Rule #8: Real Data/Errors
- Show real errors with meaningful messages
- Never fake success responses
- Real data loading states with proper UX
- API errors displayed to user with context

### Rule #9: Context Engineering (Plan Mode)
- **ALWAYS** ask clarifying questions before implementation
- Understand scope, integration points, mobile requirements
- Consider Dutch market specifics (BTW, terminology)
- Plan competitive moats and data collection opportunities

### Rule #10: Proactive Patterns
- Suggest improvements when opportunities spotted
- Identify competitive advantage opportunities
- Recommend data collection enhancements
- Point out performance optimization possibilities

### Rule #11: Always Latest Versions
- **NEVER** use hardcoded version numbers (Next.js 14, React 18, etc.)
- Always reference "Next.js latest", "React current", "TypeScript latest"
- Use Context7 MCP for current documentation, not outdated versions
- Future-proof all patterns and configurations

### Rule #12: Proactive Git Commits (CRITICAL)
- **Suggest git commit** after ANY meaningful progress made
- **Commit before risky changes** or major refactoring attempts
- **MANDATORY commit** after EVERY production-level feature completion
- Enable easy rollback with "go back to beginning" or "go back one step"
- Multiple granular commits better than one large commit

### Rule #13: Security-First Development (CRITICAL)
- **ALWAYS** run Semgrep security scan before committing
- **NEVER** store sensitive data in code (API keys, passwords)
- **VALIDATE** all user inputs with Zod schemas
- **CHECK** GDPR compliance for all data operations
- **SCAN** for AI prompt injection vulnerabilities
- **ENFORCE** API authentication and rate limiting
- **PROTECT** multi-tenant data isolation with RLS
- **MONITOR** security patterns for competitive advantage
