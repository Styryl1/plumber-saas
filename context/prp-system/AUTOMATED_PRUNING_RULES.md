# Automated Pruning Rules & Migration Thresholds

> **Purpose**: Automatic pattern lifecycle management with clear migration criteria
> **Goal**: Maintain pattern library health while preserving valuable knowledge

## 🎯 Pruning Thresholds

### Pattern Migration Rules (Automated)
```yaml
Migration_From_Current_To_Reference:
  trigger_conditions:
    - pattern_value_score: <8 points
    - usage_frequency: <3 uses in 30 days
    - stability_period: >30 days without changes
    - success_rate: >85% (proven stable)
  
Migration_From_Reference_To_Archive:
  trigger_conditions:
    - pattern_value_score: <4 points
    - usage_frequency: 0 uses in 90 days
    - superseded_by: new pattern with >95% success rate
    - technology_obsolete: dependency deprecated/removed

Migration_From_Archive_To_Deletion:
  trigger_conditions:
    - usage_frequency: 0 uses in 365 days
    - pattern_value_score: 0 points
    - no_historical_value: not referenced in any active patterns
    - storage_optimization: archive >10MB, pattern <100 bytes value
```

### Line Count Limits (Auto-consolidation Triggers)
```yaml
Current_Patterns_Limits:
  max_lines_per_file: 500
  max_patterns_per_file: 20
  auto_consolidation_trigger: 400 lines
  
Reference_Patterns_Limits:
  max_lines_per_file: 1000
  max_patterns_per_file: 50
  archive_migration_trigger: 800 lines
  
Archive_Limits:
  max_lines_per_directory: 10000
  compression_trigger: 5000 lines
  deletion_consideration: 50000 lines + >2 years old
```

## 🤖 Automated Pruning Process

### Daily Automated Tasks:
```yaml
Pattern_Health_Check:
  - update_usage_counters: track pattern references in new implementations
  - calculate_success_rates: monitor feature implementation outcomes
  - flag_migration_candidates: identify patterns meeting migration criteria
  - generate_alerts: notify when patterns approach thresholds

Pattern_Maintenance:
  - compress_archive_files: reduce storage for old patterns
  - update_metadata: refresh pattern statistics and metrics
  - validate_links: ensure pattern cross-references are valid
  - backup_changes: maintain change history for rollback capability
```

### Weekly Automated Tasks:
```yaml
Migration_Processing:
  - execute_approved_migrations: move patterns between tiers
  - update_cross_references: maintain links between related patterns
  - generate_migration_reports: document what was moved and why
  - optimize_file_structure: reorganize patterns for better access

Consolidation_Analysis:
  - identify_similar_patterns: find consolidation opportunities
  - calculate_consolidation_value: estimate benefit of merging patterns
  - propose_consolidation_plans: generate recommendations for review
  - schedule_consolidation_tasks: plan implementation of approved consolidations
```

### Monthly Automated Tasks:
```yaml
Deep_Analysis:
  - pattern_library_health_report: comprehensive metrics and trends
  - competitive_advantage_analysis: assess pattern value vs competitors
  - knowledge_gap_identification: find areas needing new patterns
  - optimization_opportunity_assessment: identify improvement possibilities

Archive_Management:
  - compress_old_archives: reduce storage for patterns >6 months old
  - suggest_deletion_candidates: patterns with no value after 1+ years
  - historical_value_assessment: identify patterns with research/reference value
  - storage_optimization: balance accessibility with storage efficiency
```

## 🛡️ Safety Mechanisms

### Pattern Protection Rules:
```yaml
Never_Auto_Delete:
  - patterns_with_competitive_advantage: moat-building patterns
  - netherlands_specific_patterns: Dutch market optimizations
  - architecture_foundation_patterns: fundamental system patterns
  - high_success_rate_patterns: >95% success rate regardless of usage

Require_Human_Approval:
  - consolidation_of_successful_patterns: >90% success rate consolidations
  - deletion_of_domain_expertise: Netherlands/plumbing specific knowledge
  - migration_of_recent_patterns: <90 days old pattern movements
  - changes_affecting_competitive_moats: business advantage patterns
```

### Rollback Capabilities:
```yaml
Version_Control:
  - maintain_pattern_history: full change tracking for all patterns
  - enable_easy_rollback: one-click restoration of previous versions
  - track_migration_impact: monitor success rates after migrations
  - alert_on_degradation: notify if pattern changes reduce success rates

Recovery_Procedures:
  - restore_from_archive: bring back archived patterns if needed
  - rebuild_from_git_history: recover accidentally deleted patterns
  - regenerate_from_success_cases: recreate patterns from successful implementations
  - escalate_to_human_review: flag critical pattern recovery needs
```

## 📊 Pruning Success Metrics

### Efficiency Metrics:
```yaml
Pattern_Library_Health:
  - average_pattern_value_score: target >6.0
  - pattern_reuse_percentage: target >60%
  - implementation_time_reduction: target -20% monthly
  - storage_optimization: target 50% reduction in total lines

Knowledge_Quality:
  - pattern_success_rate_improvement: target +5% quarterly
  - developer_onboarding_speed: target -50% time to productivity
  - feature_development_velocity: target +25% implementation speed
  - competitive_advantage_preservation: maintain 100% of moat patterns
```

```

## 🎯 Pattern Lifecycle States

### State Transitions:
```yaml
Pattern_States:
  1. New: Recently created, under evaluation (0-30 days)
  2. Active: High usage, proven successful (Current Patterns)
  3. Stable: Lower usage but reliable (Reference Patterns)
  4. Legacy: Outdated but potentially valuable (Archive)
  5. Obsolete: No longer relevant (Deletion Candidate)

Transition_Triggers:
  New → Active: >5 successful uses, >85% success rate
  Active → Stable: <3 uses/month but >85% success rate
  Stable → Legacy: <1 use/quarter but historical value
  Legacy → Obsolete: 0 uses for 1+ years, no historical value
  Any → Deletion: Obsolete + no recovery value + storage pressure
```

### State-Specific Rules:
```yaml
New_Pattern_Rules:
  - protection_level: high (require approval for major changes)
  - evaluation_period: 30 days minimum before migration
  - success_tracking: detailed metrics for performance assessment
  - feedback_collection: gather developer experience data

Active_Pattern_Rules:
  - protection_level: maximum (require approval for any changes)
  - optimization_priority: highest (continuous improvement)
  - testing_requirements: comprehensive validation before changes
  - documentation_standards: complete examples and edge cases

Stable_Pattern_Rules:
  - protection_level: medium (allow minor optimizations)
  - maintenance_mode: periodic review and updates
  - migration_readiness: prepared for archive migration
  - reference_quality: comprehensive documentation for occasional use

Legacy_Pattern_Rules:
  - protection_level: low (allow automated archival)
  - historical_preservation: maintain for research and recovery
  - storage_optimization: compress for space efficiency
  - deletion_consideration: evaluate for obsolescence

Obsolete_Pattern_Rules:
  - protection_level: minimal (allow deletion with approval)
  - final_review: human confirmation before deletion
  - backup_preservation: maintain in separate backup system
  - knowledge_extraction: capture any remaining value before deletion
```
