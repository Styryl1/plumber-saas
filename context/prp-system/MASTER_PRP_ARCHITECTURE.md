## 📊 **Unified AI Brain Architecture**

### **Central Intelligence Hub**
```
🧠 One AI Brain Powers Everything:
├── Customer Chatbots (Widget + Marketplace)
├── Plumber AI Assistant (Dashboard Integration → Business Partner)
├── Emergency Dispatch Intelligence
├── Diagnostic Decision Engine
└── Voice AI (Human-Indistinguishable Conversations)

🔄 Continuous Learning Loop:
Customer Data → Plumber Validation → AI Improvement → Better Experience → More Customers
```

### **Specialized Learning Domains** (Structure + Unified Intelligence)
```
📚 Domain Specialization:
├── 🔧 Diagnostic Patterns (Visual + Voice + Text)
├── 🚨 Emergency Classification & Response
├── 🗣️ Natural Language Understanding (Dutch + English)
├── ⏱️ Job Timing & Complexity Prediction
├── 🇳🇱 Dutch Market Intelligence (BTW, KvK, Regulations)
└── 🎯 Customer Journey Optimization

💡 Data Flow: Specialized Collection → Unified Analysis → Cross-Domain Learning
```

## 🎖️ **Tri-Level Plumber Feedback System** (Maximum Learning Velocity)

### **Level 1: Passive Data Collection** (Always Running)
```javascript
// Automatic learning from plumber behavior
const passiveFeedback = {
  invoiceAdjustments: "AI estimated €150, plumber invoiced €175 (+16.7%)",
  timeDeviations: "AI predicted 2 hours, actual job took 2.5 hours (+25%)",
  materialChanges: "AI suggested basic valve, plumber used premium (+€45)",
  beforeAfterPhotos: "Visual validation of diagnostic accuracy",
  customerSatisfaction: "5-star review = diagnostic accuracy confirmation"
}
```

### **Level 2: Active Feedback** (Incentivized)
```javascript
// Rewarded detailed corrections
const activeFeedback = {
  diagnosticCorrections: {
    aiDiagnosis: "pipe leak",
    plumberCorrection: "joint failure",
    reward: "€2 credit + priority support ticket response"
  },
  complexityFeedback: {
    aiEstimate: "standard repair",
    plumberInput: "required custom fabrication",
    reward: "€5 credit + featured in knowledge base"
  }
}
```

### **Level 3: Voice Expertise Sharing** (Premium Rewards)
```javascript
// Voice explanations for complex scenarios
const voiceExpertise = {
  expertInsights: "30-second voice note explaining diagnostic approach",
  troubleshootingTips: "Voice walkthrough of complex repair technique",
  customerCommunication: "How to explain technical issues to customers",
  rewards: "€10 credit + recognition as 'Expert Contributor' + priority marketplace jobs"
}
```

### **Reward Mechanism Structure**
```
💰 Credit System:
- Level 1: Automatic €0.50/useful correction
- Level 2: €2-5 for detailed feedback  
- Level 3: €10+ for voice expertise

🏆 Recognition System:
- Expert Contributor Badge
- Knowledge Base Attribution
- Priority Marketplace Dispatch
- Annual "Top AI Trainer" Awards

📊 Business Benefits:
- Before/after photos = Marketing content
- Voice explanations = Training material
- Diagnostic corrections = AI accuracy improvement
```

## 🚨 **T3 Stack Integration** (Migrated for T3 Project)

### **Automated PRP Workflow for T3 Stack**
```typescript
// src/lib/prp-workflow.ts
export const createPRP = async (userPrompt: string) => {
  const complexity = detectComplexity(userPrompt);
  const prpId = generatePRPId(complexity);
  
  // Auto-load specialist patterns
  const patterns = await loadSpecialistPatterns(complexity);
  
  // Generate complete context
  const prp = {
    id: prpId,
    complexity,
    businessContext: generateBusinessContext(userPrompt),
    technicalContext: patterns,
    competitiveStrategy: generateCompetitiveStrategy(userPrompt),
    implementationGuidance: generateImplementationGuidance(patterns)
  };
  
  return prp;
};
```

### **T3 Stack Hooks Integration**
```javascript
// T3 project hooks configuration
const prpHooks = {
  "user-prompt-submit-hook": "scripts/load-context.js",
  "tool-call-hook": "scripts/prp-workflow-engine.js",
  "file-change-hook": "scripts/validate-patterns.js"
};
```
