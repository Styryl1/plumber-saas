## 🔄 Parallel Operation Instructions

### **How to Resume and Use Agents in Parallel**

#### **Step 1: Reset Claude and Resume Context**
```bash
# In Claude Code CLI
claude-code --resume

# This loads the complete CLAUDE.md context including:
# - Complete PRP System Implementation Guide
# - Agent Configuration Guide (this file)
# - All specialist agent specifications
```

#### **Step 2: Launch Multiple Agents Simultaneously**
```bash
# Launch 3 agents in parallel for maximum efficiency
@ui-specialist-agent Create the complete UI component library
@ux-design-agent Create behavioral psychology patterns  
@ai-instruction-agent Create Dutch plumber AI prompts

# Or specific tasks:
@ui-specialist-agent /dashboard/UI_COMPONENTS.md with Schedule-X patterns
@ux-design-agent /widget/CONVERSION_OPTIMIZATION.md for booking psychology
@ai-instruction-agent /ai-core/AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md for dual-model routing
```

#### **Step 3: Coordinate Agent Outputs**
Each agent will work independently on their specialized outputs:
- **UI Specialist**: Creates visual implementation patterns
- **UX Design**: Creates behavioral psychology patterns
- **AI Instruction**: Creates prompt engineering patterns
- **Results**: Combined for "Perfect LOOKS + Perfect FEEL + Perfect AI"
