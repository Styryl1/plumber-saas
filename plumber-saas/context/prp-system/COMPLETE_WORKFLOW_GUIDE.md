---

## 🔄 **Complete Automated Workflow**

### **How It Works Now:**
```
1. User Prompt → 2. Automatic PRP Creation → 3. Archon Tasks → 4. Agent Patterns → 5. Implementation → 6. Feedback → 7. Learning
```

### **Step-by-Step Breakdown:**

#### **1. User Input (You)**
- Enter any development request in normal conversation
- Examples: "Add Schedule-X calendar", "Fix mobile issues", "Create payment integration"

#### **2. Automatic Detection & PRP Creation** 
```javascript
// Hooks automatically detect complexity and trigger workflow
Hook: user-prompt-submit-hook → scripts/load-context.js

Detection Logic:
- Implementation keywords → Create PRP workflow
- Debug/question keywords → Load standard context
- Auto-select complexity: Simple/Medium/Complex
```

#### **3. Archon Task Coordination**
```javascript
// Archon creates structured tasks and coordinates specialists
Result: {
  taskId: "task_123",
  specialists: ["ui-specialist-agent", "t3-specialist-agent"],
  estimatedTime: "4-6 hours",
  patterns: ["Schedule-X integration", "tRPC binding"]
}
```

#### **4. Agent Pattern Suggestions**
```javascript
// Specialist agents provide domain expertise
Patterns: {
  requiredPatterns: ["Calendar integration patterns", "Drag-drop functionality"],
  recommendedApproaches: ["Follow existing component structure"],
  exampleCode: ["Reference dashboard implementations"],
  warnings: ["Test mobile responsiveness", "Check shared components"]
}
```

#### **5. Implementation Context Delivered**
```javascript
// Complete context ready for one-pass implementation
Context: {
  prpId: "prp_123_complex",
  implementationGuidance: "Complete step-by-step approach",
  technicalPatterns: "All required patterns loaded",
  businessContext: "Competitive moat strategy included",
  validationCriteria: "Success criteria defined"
}
```

#### **6. Implementation (You + Claude)**
- Receive complete context with all business + technical details
- Implement feature following PRP guidance
- All edge cases, mobile responsiveness, and competitive advantages included

#### **7. Automatic Feedback Collection**
```bash
# After implementation, provide feedback
node scripts/prp-feedback-collector.js workflow_123 true --actual-time "3 hours"
```

#### **8. Learning Loop Completion**
```javascript
// System learns and improves for next time
Learning: {
  timeAccuracy: "Improved estimation algorithms",
  patternEffectiveness: "Successful patterns reinforced",
  competitiveMoats: "Data velocity increased",
  futureOptimization: "Next similar task will be 40% faster"
}
```

## 🛠️ **Your New Development Experience**

### **Before PRP System:**
```
❌ Old Process:
1. "Add calendar to jobs page"
2. 15+ back-and-forth clarifications
3. Missing business context
4. Technical implementation without learning strategy
5. No competitive advantage building
6. Context scattered across multiple files
```

### **With PRP System:**
```
✅ New Process:
1. "Add Schedule-X calendar integration" 
2. Automatic PRP workflow triggered
3. Complete context loaded in seconds
4. Business + technical + competitive strategy included
5. One-pass implementation with all edge cases
6. Competitive moat building with every feature
```

### **Example Development Session:**

**You:** "Add Schedule-X calendar to jobs page with drag-drop functionality"

**System Response:**
```
🚀 PRP Workflow Complete: COMPLEX Feature

📋 PRP Details:
- ID: prp_123_complex
